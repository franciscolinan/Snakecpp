# Snake Game in C++

## Description

This repository contains the source code for a classic Snake game implemented in C++ as a university project. Due to the project's scope and requirements, the code is contained within a single file, and the comments are in Spanish to meet the project's guidelines.

The game features a snake represented by "*" characters, and the player controls the snake to eat food represented by '*' characters, growing in length with each consumed food. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive console-based user interface
- Real-time control of the snake's movement using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- Randomly generated food for the snake to eat
- Score tracking and display
- Game over detection when the snake collides with the wall or its own body

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement
- Try to eat the food ('*') to grow in length and score points
- Avoid hitting the walls or colliding with the snake's own body, as this will result in game over

Have fun playing the Snake Game!
